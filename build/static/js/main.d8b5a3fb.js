trying not to break\nIn the art of war\nIs there something more\nOr am I alone?\nI never know what I'm looking for\nJust something more\n\nSometimes I wonder\nIf I were bird\nWould I be so serious\nIf my feet could leave the dirt\nCuz down here I fear\nI've become far too concerned\nWith everything I'm given\nAnd nothing that I've earned\n\nIn the art of war\nIs there something more\nOr am I alone?\nI never know what I'm looking for\nJust something more\n\nDear mother I'm tired\nI feel I'm over my head\nI'm haunted I'm wired\nI only wanted yesterday\nThis time I'm not trying\nThis time I'll feel no pain\nI'm haunted I'm wired\nDear mother I'm tired\n"},{name:"Running In The Night",author:"FM 84",img:"../imgs/fm84.gif",audio:"../sngs/FM84-Running In The Night(feat Ollie

ground\nI wanna take you to that place in the Roche\nBut no one gives us any time anymore\nHe asks me once if I'd look in on his dog\nYou made an offer for it, then you ran off\nI got this picture of us kids in my head\nAnd all I hear is the last thing that you said\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nI listened to your problems, now listen to mine\nI didn't want to anymore, oh-oh-oh\n\n[Chorus]\nAnd we will never

thought he saw someone that looked just like me\nThe summer memory that just never dies\nWe worked too long and hard to give it no time\nHe sees right through me, it's so easy with lies\nCracks in the road that I would try and disguise\nHe runs his scissors at the seam in the wall\nHe cannot break it down or else he would fall\nOne thousand lonely stars hiding in the cold\nTake it, oh, I don't wanna sing anymore\n\n[Instrumental Break]\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nI listened to your problems, now listen to mine\nI didn't want to anymore, oh-oh-oh\n\n[Chorus]\nAnd we will never be alone again\n'Cause it
